## Striso Documentation

Here you will find the official documentation of the Striso board, which are planned to be written in the coming months. 

The Striso board production is currently being funded at [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/striso/striso-board).
More information about the Striso instruments can be found on www.striso.org.

User contributed documentation is available on the [wiki](https://github.com/striso/striso-docs/wiki), and can be edited by everyone who wants to contribute.
